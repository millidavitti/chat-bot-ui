# Chat Bot

This demo is intended to evaluate my skills in frontend development,
particularly in creating user interfaces, implementing responsive design, and handling basic interactions.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Node.js (Preferably the latest stable version)

You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/millidavitti/chat-bot-ui.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd chat-bot-ui
```

Install the project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the server, and you should be able to access the application on `http://localhost:3000` or another port if specified.
